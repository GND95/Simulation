This "game" is a simulated ecosystem where the white dots are bugs and the smaller green dots are food. There is a secondary form that is created that plots the bug population to food ratio in realtime. The white line on the graph is the bug population. The green line on the graph is the amount of food. The gold line on the graph is the food production. The dark grey line on the graph is the bug deaths.
